 On this repo are described the steps followed to install Ubuntu 22.04.5 OS and 
 Abaqus 6.14-5 on a Laptop with a Pentium Gold 6405U processor.
 
 1.- A live Unbuntu 22.04.1 session was run on the lap with a new and 
     empty SSD without any OS installed.
     
 2.- From the live session the Unbuntu 22.04.5 was downloaded and a bootable 
     USB was created.
     
 3.- The live session was terminated and the Unbuntu 22.04.5 OS was installed
     from the bootable USB.
     
 4.- Thereafter, we proceeded to install Abaqus 6.14-5.
 
 5.- The laps specs were collected with an .sh script.
